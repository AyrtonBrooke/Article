    <br> 
    <p>    Police data in England and Wales shows over 1/3 increase in dog attacks in the past five years. The BBC, investigated last year and found there were 22,000 cases of out-of-control dogs causing injury, compared to 2018 where there were just over 16,000. Each day three children are being treated in hospital for dog bites. </p>        
    <br><br> 
    <p>        Last year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Defra, said, “There have been nine tragic fatalities this year as a result of dog attacks, several of which involved children. We take this disturbing rise extremely seriously and are exploring measures to reduce dog attacks and promote responsible ownership.”    </p>
    <br><br> 
    <p>        Ewan Mackintosh, a dog behaviourist based in London, explains why these vicious attacks occur, he said, “It is very alarming to see the amount of cases happening, especially some people being even killed, after being attacked, it is shocking really.” He added, “I don’t so much blame the breed; I always blame the owners, if the owners have not had their dogs trained... then it will lead to problems.” </p>

    <p>Under UK law, the owner is responsible for the dog’s actions. The consensus is that the dog is usually never to blame in an attack. How they treat their pet is crucial to the animal’s welfare. Jessica Jordan, 23, recounts the time she was shocked to be face to face with her neighbour's dog, who somehow found a way to her kitchen, her dog and the neighbour's dog were growling at each other, she said, “I didn’t really know what to do, I was anxious and scared, and I started shouting, trying to get the dog away, but it wasn’t going away.” Her aunt came down and pushed the dog to leave. When asked who was to blame in that incident Jessica said, “It’s hard to say, but I do think it is down to the owner and how they train and treat the dog.” </p>

    <p>Eight years ago, Fabian Tudic, 21, studying at Brighton University, was at a pub playing with his friends, when he saw a dog coming towards him and attacked him. He said, “I don’t know why it attacked me, it was off its leash, the owner ran towards me but the dog bit me by my leg.” He adds, “It was a deep bite... it was just kind of scary.” Fabian is also a dog lover and recently owns a puppy, he blames himself for the incident that occurred, he says, “The dog did not know any better and the owner couldn’t have predicted the attack... if I was to blame anyone, I’d blame myself for not being more cautious around dogs.” </p>

    <br><br>
    <p>There are specific legal measures to discourage dog owners from disobeying rules; sentencing owners who let their dog be out of control, or warranting a disqualification order that prevents them from keeping their dogs for a certain period. And charging owners, a £2,500 fine if they breach a community protection notice, which is designed to stop anti-social behavior. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>However, there is still the burning question, why have dog attacks increased in the past five years? According to the Freedom of Information Act, FOI, obtained by the BBC, the number of dog owners during the pandemic soared to approximately 10%. There is still uncertainty as to why the numbers have gone up, but there are different theories.  </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>One of the potential reasons is, dogs may have lost their ability to socialize with people and other pets, due to everyone being at home more even after the lockdown, causing them to lose their safe space to retreat to, and therefore leading to an increase in anxiety and stress. The Dogs Trust Annual Report showed that 1 in 10 dogs in the UK developed new signs of separation-related behaviour during the lockdown. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Another factor is, people not training their dogs properly, especially new dog owners, as animal behaviorist Mr Mackintosh mentions in his blog, dogs need to socialize with other dogs, and owners need to treat their pets with respect and form a strong bond with them. He added, “Another key skill imparted by puppy training, is crate training. This skill is essential for fostering independence in your animal. With crate training, your pet learns not to panic when left alone... furthermore, it reduces the possibility of your pet going into a frenzy and turning destructive.” Crate training has been recognized by the RSCPA as an effective way to train puppies to be left alone and feel comfortable during transport.  </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>An additional aspect to consider is the sourcing of dogs from the internet. It has been proven by Defra as too easy, and potentially harmful, as it can reduce the understanding of the required commitment to own a dog. Their research shows multiple websites where one can easily purchase a dog, such as Gumtree and Preloved. People are probably getting their puppies from unknown backgrounds. Unbeknownst to the new owners, their puppy could be unsocialized, and have insufficient care. </p>
    <br><br>

        <br>
        <i class="small">During 2021/22, Royal Mail reported 1,673 dog attacks on its staff, resulting in severe injuries, including permanent disabilities. </i>   
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>There are now several sets of measures set by the Government and Defra to reduce cases of dog attacks; any adverts about selling a dog should include a photo of the animal, its age, details of the breeder, and sources of advice for pet care. Police are involved if anyone is suspected of selling illegal dogs on websites. Over the past year, 130,000 problematic advertisements have been removed. The government financially supports charity education initiatives aimed at promoting responsible dog ownership in schools and inner-city estates. Additionally, animal welfare charities are equipped to provide more information and advice to potential owners; for example, it is recommended that prospective dog owners, prioritize adopting a rescue dog over acquiring a new puppy, or if they decide to buy a puppy – encouraging them to do so, through a licensed UK based-source. 
    <br><br>
    <p>According to PDSA (People's Dispensary for Sick Animals charity), in a case of a dog attack, here are several warning signs to know, that could help de-escalate a dangerous situation: 
        <br> signs are less obvious than the usual growls and snaps   
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Licking their lips </li>
        <li>Ears going backwards flattened on their head </li>
        <li>Yawning </li>
        <li>Showing the whites of their eyes ("whale eye" – lookout for a white half-moon shape)  </li>
        <li>Turning their face away  </li>
        <li>Trying to move or turn away from the other dog  </li>
        <li>Standing crouched or walking low to the ground. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>It must be noted that dogs rarely attack unexpectedly, it is usually because they are frightened or unhappy. The PDSA encourages owners to give their dogs some space when they notice these behavioural signs of stress.  </p>

    <p>Renting in London has proven to be more uncertain over the year, the average monthly rent cost in one of the most expensive cities is £2,500. The demand for rented homes has increased by 10% in the last year, and fewer homes are available for rent, according to Rightmove, a property website. It is causing a massive issue with supply and demand, hence why prospective Tenants are having to compete to secure a home, without really considering if the available property meets their requirements.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>        Ayrton Brooke, 21, studying at Staffordshire University in London, accounts for getting his first flat last year. He said he was aware of the potential challenges he would face, finding private property as a student, but was not expecting to be in search of a flat for almost three months. He had to resort to bidding for several flats. He said, “There were about 50 other viewers for one singular flat, so we went on a minimum of 15 views in all of East London.” He added, “I'd see the documentation that would say the flat was previously £1,200, maybe from like last year, and then they’d advertise on Zoopla as £1,500, but if you click on the document that was linked off, then it would be a lot cheaper, it isn’t fair for everything to go up, because they know the demand is high, the person that can offer the most money, they are obviously going to take.” </p>

    <br><br>
    <p>Ayrton Brooke managed to rent a small flat with his partner for £1,100, bills included, He said, “We had a few arrangements with the Landlord to solve the mold issue – and we also talked to the neighbors, saying that they had the same issue.” He added, “It was like a house, which was split into small flats, like apartments, which was quite dodgy as well.” He further explained that the electric meter was only accessible on his side of the house, so the neighbors would have to ring him to access electricity. He also said, the Landlord offered a dehumidifier, which did not help with the mold issue. When asked who was to blame for the mould problem, Ayrton said, “We are at fault, but mostly them, if the whole place has mold issues, sometimes it is about how the building is made, if the walls have mold inside, then it must be redone. Ayrton also speaks about his experience with his second flat, he said, “In the second year now, everything has gone up in price, so it is hard to balance that as well.” </p>

    <p>        According to last year’s English House survey, around a quarter of private housing did not meet the decent home standard. They say the properties were in disrepair, could not be heated or insulated or posed a risk to health. Furthermore, in line with the UK (United Kingdom) parliament research, there are concerns that households are choosing between “heating or eating “over the winter months with the financial pressures people are facing due to the rise in the cost of living.  </p>   
    <br><br>
    <p>Property owners in the private sector are having to raise their rent, as the surge in property prices has translated to higher mortgages. Whilst, over the last summer, according to Propertymark, a 13% increase of Landlords, are selling their properties as they cannot keep up with the rent crisis. The increased demand is worsening supply shortages. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I spoke with the mother of Ayrton Brooke, Manizheh Brooke, 50, mother of three, who came really close to being evacuated from her home in Haringey. Her landlord decided to increase her rent, she was given a section 21 notice, which gives her two months' notice to leave. She said, “The council said to me, even if I have section 21, that I am not homeless, I am threatened homeless.” she explained that she must wait five to six months for a contract from the council to find a new house, but the houses they offered, she said were, “low in the condition of living.”  She explained that DSS tenants have no other options but to live in these poorly maintained council homes. </p> 
    <br><br>
    <p>Manizheh is considered a DSS tenant, which is a private tenant who claims benefits. She said, “In London, it is very hard to find a place, especially for people who are DSS tenants – it is different for each area, for example for a two-bedroom house in Haringey, you can only get £1,300, but the houses here start from £1,500 upwards.” She added, “so you have to fill that gap with the benefit money, which is not easy.” Manizheh has mobility restrictions which inhibit her from going upstairs in her home, Mrs. Brooke also requested a mobility-friendly home but was not given the option. Luckily, Manizheh and her landlord came to an agreement, she still resides at the property. </p>

    <p>Richard Donnell, the Executive Director of Zoopla said: “Increasing investment in new rental supply from multiple sources is the main route to reducing rental growth and making for a more sustainable private rented sector.”      </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Rightmove’s Director of Property Science Tim Bannister said: “We have seen some early signs of improvement on squeezed supply levels this year, though with no significant influx of new properties becoming available to rent currently on the horizon, the mismatch is set to continue for some time.  </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>In terms of help from the government, in a parliamentary inquiry on local housing allowance (LHA) rates, Minister Mims Davies said “In 2020 Local Housing Allowance rates were raised to the 30th percentile, a significant investment of almost £1 billion, we have maintained the increase since then so that everyone who benefited from the increase continues to do so. She added that “Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) are available for those who face a shortfall in meeting their housing costs. Since 2011 we have provided nearly £1.6 billion in funding to local authorities for DHPs. However, people like the Brooke family, have no other option but to take what they can get and hope for the market rent to stabilize in the near future. </p>

    <h1 class="title">Wellcome collection – Colonialism and the origins of skin bleaching and the desire for lighter skin </h1>
    <p><span class="this">This</span> article has inspired me, in numerous ways. It has spread awareness of institutional colourism in colonized countries, it has featured dark-skinned activists, that are fighting to break the narrative, that “darker skin” is not as attractive as “lighter skin.” The article which speaks about the usage of bleaching products for a lighter complexion, has made me reflect on my privileges and the resources I can use to spread more awareness on societal issues such as this. With the intent of being a journalist, this has been one of many articles that have shaped and formed my interest in social and political issues, through investigating to find out the truth.</p>    
    <br><br>  
    <p>    For a period, I lived in Nigeria, and I realized now, as a lighter skin woman, I was treated differently. The other girls at school had to have their hair in braids or a buzz cut, and I got away with wearing my natural curls. I had some understanding that I was put on a pedestal due to my European features. However, it is not years down the line that I realized how much leverage I have compared to darker-skinned people and how this issue is on a much bigger scale.      </p>   
    <br><br>
    <p>        I would notice the women in my community purchasing creams that had the title “fair,” but never really questioned it, even if I was told it was a common thing to do here. Some Nigerian women were lighter in complexion than their female counterparts, as a child it did not register, that bleach was used, and that it was not a byproduct of their genetics. They chose to bleach their skin to have access to a higher status, which comes with a comfortable life and at times, a luxurious lifestyle. Unfortunately, my country Nigeria has the highest number of women using skin-bleaching products in Africa. However, there is some hope that things are changing, as countries such as South Africa, Rwanda and Ghana are taking the initiative to ban any bleaching product for the purpose of lighter skin.     </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>    What shocked me is what people must endure to get their desired result, it is said by the NHS to cause so many skin complications and the result is not guaranteed. Additionally, the severe repercussions are life-threatening, I have seen it done by a pregnant woman which can cause abnormality for a newborn baby.     </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>        In hindsight, darker-skin people, endure a lot of psychological damage due to the many decades of indoctrination that white is deemed “beautiful.” And for some, any route to get to a shade lighter, for their life to have more advantages is a choice they will make. I had to really understand why some people would choose to undergo such a strenuous process and begin to understand the root cause of the issue.      </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>        Upon reading the article, doing more research on the matter, and understanding historically why lighter skin is still put on a pedestal in various places, I realized, there are more people that are aware of the way colonialism and imperialism have affected the way we see beauty today. However, I was still curious as to why the skin-whitening industry is estimated to be worth $31.2 billion by 2024, (which is astronomical), and as I mentioned earlier, I came to find out how complex the issue is, much like any other social issue. I learned from this article that skin bleaching did not actually start in those colonized continents and that Elizabeth the first, was known to have used white lead on her face.     </p>
    <br><br> 
    <p>        Professor Shirley Anne Tate speaks more about the intricacies of skin bleaching, in the article she said, “When you have a situation like enslavement and colonialism, where you have societies which are very structured racially, where white is always at the top, black or mixed at the bottom, and then the mixed-race population in the middle, of course, you will have people try to negotiate the market in skin shade, you know for betterment, it makes political sense, doesn’t it... people are just responding to the context in which they find themselves.”    </p>
    <br><br> 
    <p>            In the present day, things have changed massively. There is now a lot more representation of dark-skinned people in the media. However, from what I have gathered, there are still hierarchies that dictate who comes first in line due to decades of indoctrination." This article has highlighted the systematic issue that “fair” is prettier, a lot of people still subconsciously believe that. This has given me a lot of insight into the actuality of how things are, rather than my perspective on it. I aim to apply this core value in my journalism course and in my daily life, and as a future journalist, it is essential for me to report accurately and truthfully.     </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>            What I appreciate about the article is the interviews with people who went through the process of skin-whitening, it brings this personal element that engages with the reader. I have always wanted to interview people from all social classes to understand them and their situation. In the process of finding my path in the industry, I am going to start writing a blog about social issues that includes research, interviews, and photographs. I will also put more effort into my LinkedIn profile by posting my work and sharing my opinion features, to build a reliable portfolio that will help me gain more opportunities and potentially a job role, in investigating social issues. I am also applying for an internship next summer, and targeting more roles that are aligned with my interests. I am reading more books about social issues and history to gain insight, as this helps my writing. I also consume a lot of video essays about social issues, and I keep up to date with general news. There are no major companies that I necessarily want to work for, but any company that has similar attributes to "Vice" is ideally what I seek in my career path.     </p>
